        NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming. <br>
        Especially if you’ve never been. Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s guide and <br>
        make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following  <br>
        your gut. You’ll have an unforgettable experience! <br>
      </p>
      <h2> Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows </h2>

      <p>
        If you’re lucky or connected, you can get an invite sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or <br>
        connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are the most <br>
        important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying <br>
        about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and <br>
        times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get <br>
        excited! <br>
      </p>
      <h2> Dressing for the Shows </h2>

      <p>
        Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time <br>
        and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express  <br>
        through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously, you want to <br>
        look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared. <br>
